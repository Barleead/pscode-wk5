// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

a + b = c

num1 + num2 = sum
print sum

ask for 2 numbers 
add the 2 number together 
print on the screen the sum of those 2 numbers


// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

#aquire number 
ask  for user input of a number

#compare numbers

if the number / 2 has  no remainder
	print "even"
else #the number has a remainder
	print"odd

	

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are


#psuedocode step a

	ask user to input 5 numbers as num1, num2, num3, num4, num5

#psuedocode step b  calculate  the average 

	total = num1 + num2 + num3 + num4 + num5 

	average = total/5

#psuedocode step c  min and max



1) numbers = (num1, num2, num3, num4, num5)
## use actual values
min = num1
max = num1
2) # use a loop to compare num2 - num5 to min and max
for each number in numbers
if number is > max 
	then replace max with number
elif number is < min
	then replace min with number

compare next number


Step d

Print "the  average of the 5 numbers is " average
print " the number with the minimum value is" min
print "the number with the maximum value is" max
